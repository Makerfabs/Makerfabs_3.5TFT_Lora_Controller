LoRa Radio expansion based on the LoRa module and provided a wireless Lot solution (ESP32-LoRa). This board is designed for ESP32 3.5" TFT Touch with Camera (also for the 3.2" one), mainly used with the ESP32 3.5" TFT Touch board.

We used LoRa Radio expansion and  ESP32 3.5" TFT Touch with Camera to make a Lora control terminal, which can control multiple Lora devices at the same time through the touch screen and display the device status in real time.



## Feature

- Onboard LoRa module (433Mhz, 868Mhz or 915Mhz)
- Long communication distance: 2km or more
